## About the Deadpool
Thrones Deadpool is an app that allowed fans of Game of Thrones to predict which characters would die when during the final season of the HBO show. Prior to the season premiere, users could make pools and invite others to join their pools. Each user then filled out a bracket in which they marked each character as dying in a specific episode, or as a survivor. Scores were calculated after each episode using a Firebase Function (similar to a Lambda Function).

With minimal promotion, the game drew 810 users and 225 pools.
